## Git vs. GitHub
* ### What is Git?

 **Git** is a workspace that is for _your own self_. It's a place where you can keep different versions of the code that you type. This is _different_ because Git is a workspace that is mainly for you to keep track of what you have commited or edited to the project.

* ### What is GitHub?

 **GitHub** is a workspace that is used so that other people can _contribute_ to your project or _see the changes_ that you have made to the project itself. People can contribute by cloning, forking or sending you pull requests if they have anything they would want to add to your project. Also, **Git** is needed in order for **GitHub** to work.
